# seleniumTbot
Twitter automation using Selenium with Python. Using it to Learn web scraping(useful when no APIs are available). Might replicate this project Using Twitter API

Goal is to have it on my personal linux server and have the bot do scheduled Twitter tasks.
Working on Modularizing code for readability and reducing confusion

Twitter Tasks(scheduled daily or every 3days):
1.check my own account and follow back new followers.
2.check my best friends account and follow all the new people that he followed recently.
3.like my friends tweets.
